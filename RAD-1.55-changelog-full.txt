### RecurrentComplex-1.4.8.6.jar
**1.4.8.6**

+ There is now a new config option called `avoidPlacerChunkGeneration`. It can be used to decrease the amount of cascading chunk generation, if carefully tuned with other changes. You can read about it here: [https://github.com/NoMoreUsernames999/Recurrent-Complex-Wiki/wiki/Avoiding-cascading-chunk-generation](https://github.com/NoMoreUsernames999/Recurrent-Complex-Wiki/wiki/Avoiding-cascading-chunk-generation)  
+ /#gen now supports a --y parameter, to generate at a constant or relative height.  
+ If repeats are 0 in static generation patterns, the structure will not repeat in that axis instead of crashing.  
+ Cascading chunk generation log messages will now inform you of the structure causing it.
